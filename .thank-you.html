<p>In the rich and varied ecosystem of WordPress and Genesis, we were overwhelmed by the sheer number of themes and plugins available to power your site. And after a while we found we had a different taste. We wanted something that will help us power business sites and without reinventing the wheel. So we built something for ourselves. And with the success of each client Cuttz Framework crossed milestones. We may not be the geekiest coders on earth. But we sure are smart. And we put our users first.</p>

<p>You are now a proud owner of Cuttz Framework. And we just want to say <em>thank you for choosing Cuttz Framework</em>. You are ready to rock the most powerful Genesis theme on earth. And Cuttz Framework means some serious business. <strong>Power to you!</strong></p>
